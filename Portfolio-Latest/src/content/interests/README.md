# Interests Guide

## Adding a New Interest

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in this directory (e.g., `machine-learning.mdx`)
2. Add frontmatter with title and order
3. Write your content

## Example Structure

```mdx
---
title: "Machine Learning"
order: 1
---

# Machine Learning

Write about your interest here using Markdown or MDX!

## Subtopics
- Deep learning
- Neural networks
- etc.
```

## Fields

- **title**: The name of the interest (shows in the list)
- **order**: Number to control the display order (lower numbers appear first)

## Tips

- Interests are displayed as a simple bulleted list
- Each interest title is clickable and links to its own page
- The filename becomes the URL (e.g., `ai.mdx` â†’ `/interests/ai`)
