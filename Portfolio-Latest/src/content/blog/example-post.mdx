## What is MDX?

MDX lets you write JSX embedded in Markdown. This means you can:

- Write regular markdown like lists
- Use **bold** and *italic* text
- Add `code snippets`
- And even embed React components!

## Code Example

Here's some code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Why This Matters

With MDX, you can create rich, interactive blog posts that go beyond static content. You can embed:

- Interactive demos
- Custom styled components
- Charts and visualizations
- And anything else React can do!

## Conclusion

This is just the beginning. More posts coming soon on AI, software engineering, and product development.
